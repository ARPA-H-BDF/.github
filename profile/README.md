The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health ([ARPA-H](https://arpa-h.gov/)) [Biomedical Data Fabric (BDF) Toolbox](https://arpa-h.gov/research-and-funding/programs/arpa-h-bdf-toolbox) seeks to make it easier to connect biomedical research data from thousands of sources and overcome barriers caused by incompatible data dialects. The BDF Toolbox effort will seek to advance capabilities in five areas: (1) lowering barriers to high-fidelity, timely data collection in computer-readable forms, (2) preparation for multi-source data analysis at scale, (3) advanced and intuitive data exploration, (4) improving stakeholder access while maintaining privacy and security measures, and (5) generalizability of biomedical data fabric tools across disease types. Together novel data fabric capabilities will lower the barriers associated with data collection, reduce the time needed to integrate new data sources, and improve data usability by community members across disciplines and biomedical literacy levels.
